## 1. Letter from the CEO
Dear Stakeholders,

It is with great pride that I present BlueWave's 2022 Annual ESG Report, documenting our progress in what has been a transformative year for our company and the world. As a leading provider of water treatment solutions, we recognize that our responsibility extends beyond delivering innovative products – we must be stewards of the resources we depend upon and positive contributors to society.

The interconnected challenges of climate change, water scarcity, and social inequality have only intensified in 2022. At BlueWave, we believe businesses must be part of the solution. This conviction has driven us to deepen our commitment to environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and transparent governance.

This year, I am particularly proud of several achievements:

- Our products helped customers save over 2 billion gallons of water
- We reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 25%
- We achieved zero waste to landfill at four manufacturing facilities
- We strengthened our diversity and inclusion initiatives, with 40% of new hires from underrepresented groups
- We donated $1.5 million to water conservation projects in underserved communities

While we celebrate these accomplishments, we recognize that much work remains. The climate crisis demands urgent action, water stress affects billions worldwide, and inequality persists in many forms. Looking ahead, we are setting ambitious new targets across our ESG pillars and integrating sustainability even more deeply into our business strategy and operations.

Our commitment to transparency remains unwavering. This report has been prepared in accordance with global reporting standards and includes both our successes and areas for improvement. We welcome your feedback as we continue this journey.

Water sustains all life on Earth. As its guardians, we embrace our responsibility to ensure its availability and quality for generations to come.

Sincerely,

Maria Chen
Chief Executive Officer
BlueWave Corporation

## 5. Water Stewardship
As a water technology company, responsible water management is at the core of our business and values. We apply the same innovative approaches we offer customers to our own operations.

### Our Approach
Our water stewardship strategy has four components:
1. Efficiency: Minimizing water use in our operations
2. Quality: Ensuring our discharges meet or exceed regulatory standards
3. Context: Managing water in accordance with local watershed needs
4. Access: Supporting water access in underserved communities

### 2022 Performance
- Total water withdrawal: 825,000 cubic meters (15% reduction from 2021)
- Water recycling rate: 42% (up from 35% in 2021)
- 100% of manufacturing sites with water management plans
- Zero significant water-related compliance incidents
- Water use intensity: 0.46 cubic meters per $1,000 revenue (12% improvement)

### Water Risk Management
In 2022, we updated our global water risk assessment using the WRI Aqueduct tool and site-specific analyses. We identified 6 facilities in high or extremely high water-stressed areas, representing 28% of our production. For these sites, we have implemented comprehensive water stewardship plans that include:
- Enhanced water efficiency targets (30% reduction by 2025)
- Water recycling systems with minimum 60% reuse
- Community water projects in surrounding watersheds
- Engagement with local stakeholders on shared water challenges

### Alliance for Water Stewardship
In 2022, we achieved Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) certification for two additional facilities, bringing our total to five certified sites. We have committed to certifying all facilities in water-stressed areas by 2025.

### Spotlight: Zero Liquid Discharge
Our Chennai, India facility implemented an innovative zero liquid discharge system in 2022, eliminating all wastewater discharge while recovering 95% of water for reuse. The system combines ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, and evaporation technologies to treat and recover process water. This $2.3 million investment will save approximately 65,000 cubic meters of freshwater annually in a severely water-stressed region.

### 2030 Goals
- 50% reduction in water withdrawal intensity (2020 baseline)
- 75% water recycling rate across all operations
- 100% of facilities to implement context-based water targets
- AWS certification for all high-risk sites by 2025
- Zero liquid discharge at facilities in extremely high water-stressed areas

## 6. Climate Action
Climate change presents profound risks to water availability and quality worldwide. We recognize our responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint while helping customers adapt to a changing climate.

### Our Approach
Our climate strategy addresses both mitigation and adaptation:
- Mitigation: Reducing our operational and value chain emissions
- Adaptation: Developing solutions for climate resilience in water systems

### Emission Reduction Initiatives
Our 25% emissions reduction in 2022 was achieved through:
- Energy efficiency projects at our 12 largest manufacturing sites
- Installation of solar arrays at facilities in Arizona, Spain, and Australia
- Virtual power purchase agreement for 35 MW of wind energy
- Electrification of 30% of our vehicle fleet
- Process optimization in energy-intensive production lines

### Climate Risk Management
In 2022, we conducted climate scenario analysis aligned with TCFD recommendations. Our analysis evaluated physical and transition risks under 1.5°C, 2°C, and 3°C warming scenarios through 2050. Key findings include:
- Physical risks: Increased water stress at 35% of facilities; supply chain disruptions due to extreme weather; changing customer needs due to drought and flooding patterns
- Transition risks: Carbon pricing impacts in key markets; shifts in technology preferences; changing regulatory requirements
- Opportunities: Growing demand for water reuse and efficiency solutions; increased need for climate-resilient water infrastructure

Based on this analysis, we have updated our enterprise risk management framework and integrated climate considerations into strategic planning and capital allocation processes.

### Science-Based Targets
In 2022, we submitted our targets to the Science-Based Targets initiative for validation:
- 50% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 (2020 baseline)
- 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions intensity by 2030 (2020 baseline)

## 5. Water Stewardship
As a water technology company, responsible water management is at the core of our business and values. We apply the same innovative approaches we offer customers to our own operations.

### Our Approach
Our water stewardship strategy has four components:
1. Efficiency: Minimizing water use in our operations
2. Quality: Ensuring our discharges meet or exceed regulatory standards
3. Context: Managing water in accordance with local watershed needs
4. Access: Supporting water access in underserved communities

### 2022 Performance
- Total water withdrawal: 825,000 cubic meters (15% reduction from 2021)
- Water recycling rate: 42% (up from 35% in 2021)
- 100% of manufacturing sites with water management plans
- Zero significant water-related compliance incidents
- Water use intensity: 0.46 cubic meters per $1,000 revenue (12% improvement)

### Water Risk Management
In 2022, we updated our global water risk assessment using the WRI Aqueduct tool and site-specific analyses. We identified 6 facilities in high or extremely high water-stressed areas, representing 28% of our production. For these sites, we have implemented comprehensive water stewardship plans that include:
- Enhanced water efficiency targets (30% reduction by 2025)
- Water recycling systems with minimum 60% reuse
- Community water projects in surrounding watersheds
- Engagement with local stakeholders on shared water challenges

### Alliance for Water Stewardship
In 2022, we achieved Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) certification for two additional facilities, bringing our total to five certified sites. We have committed to certifying all facilities in water-stressed areas by 2025.

### Spotlight: Zero Liquid Discharge
Our Chennai, India facility implemented an innovative zero liquid discharge system in 2022, eliminating all wastewater discharge while recovering 95% of water for reuse. The system combines ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, and evaporation technologies to treat and recover process water. This $2.3 million investment will save approximately 65,000 cubic meters of freshwater annually in a severely water-stressed region.

### 2030 Goals
- 50% reduction in water withdrawal intensity (2020 baseline)
- 75% water recycling rate across all operations
- 100% of facilities to implement context-based water targets
- AWS certification for all high-risk sites by 2025
- Zero liquid discharge at facilities in extremely high water-stressed areas
