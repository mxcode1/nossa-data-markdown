## 1. Introduction from the CEO
Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present SunPower's 2022 Renewable Energy Report, which details our progress toward building a more sustainable future through clean energy solutions and responsible business practices.

The past year has underscored the urgency of addressing climate change while ensuring equitable access to clean, reliable energy. At SunPower, we recognize both the challenge and opportunity this represents. We are committed to accelerating the transition to renewable energy through our innovative solar solutions while operating our business in a way that respects the environment, empowers our people, and strengthens the communities where we work.

In 2022, we made significant progress on our sustainability journey. Our solar installations generated 1.2 million MWh of clean energy, avoiding approximately 850,000 tons of CO₂ emissions. We achieved 100% renewable electricity in our own operations and reduced our operational emissions by 75% since 2015. We expanded our community solar projects, bringing the benefits of clean energy to more diverse communities, and strengthened our commitment to diversity with women now representing 48% of our workforce.

Looking ahead, we are setting ambitious new targets to further reduce our environmental footprint, enhance our social impact, and maintain strong governance. We believe that as a renewable energy company, we have a special responsibility to lead by example in all aspects of sustainability.

This report outlines our approach, achievements, challenges, and plans for the future. We welcome your feedback as we continue our journey toward a more sustainable and equitable energy future.

Sincerely,

Sarah Johnson

These innovations are particularly important for projects in water-stressed regions, where we've reduced water requirements by 75%.

**Lifecycle Assessment Program**
Our comprehensive LCA program evaluates:
- Carbon footprint across all lifecycle stages
- Water consumption through manufacturing and operation
- Material intensity and resource depletion
- Potential toxicity impacts
- End-of-life recovery potential

Results inform our product design, supplier selection, and impact reduction priorities, with full transparency provided to customers and stakeholders.
