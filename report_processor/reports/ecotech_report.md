## 1. CEO Message

Dear Stakeholders,

At EcoTech, we believe technology and sustainability go hand in hand. Our 2023 Environmental Progress Report demonstrates our commitment to creating a positive impact on the planet while delivering innovative solutions to our customers.

The past year has been transformative for EcoTech. We achieved carbon neutrality for our direct operations, continued to expand our sustainable product portfolio, and strengthened our commitment to diversity and inclusion. These accomplishments reflect our belief that environmental stewardship and business success are inseparable.

Climate change remains one of the most pressing challenges of our time. I am proud to report that we have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% compared to our 2018 baseline, meeting our 2025 target two years early. We have also invested $10 million in carbon capture technologies and continued to help our customers reduce their own carbon footprints through our energy-efficient solutions.

Resource conservation is fundamental to our approach. We have achieved an 85% waste diversion rate globally, reduced water consumption by 40%, and made 95% of our packaging recyclable or compostable. Our product development follows circular economy principles, with 70% of new products designed for recyclability.

None of this would be possible without our talented and dedicated team. We have increased diversity across our organization, with 42% of technical roles now filled by women. Our scholarship program for underrepresented groups in STEM fields is helping to build a more inclusive technology sector for the future.

Looking ahead, we are setting ambitious new goals to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain by 2030 and lead our industry in sustainable innovation. We know that technology companies have a special responsibility to drive positive change, and we are committed to meeting that challenge.

This report outlines our progress, our challenges, and our vision for the future. We welcome your feedback as we continue our sustainability journey.

Sincerely,

Alex Chen
President and CEO
