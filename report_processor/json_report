Key findings include: - Physical risks: Increased water stress at 35% of facilities; supply chain disruptions due to extreme weather; changing customer needs due to drought and flooding patterns - Transition risks: Carbon pricing impacts in key markets; shifts in technology preferences; changing regulatory requirements - Opportunities: Growing demand for water reuse and efficiency solutions; increased need for climate-resilient water infrastructure"
